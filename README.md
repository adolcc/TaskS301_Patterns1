**Design Patterns**

This series of exercises focuses on identifying and applying three fundamental software design patterns, essential for creating robust, scalable, and reusable code.

Singleton Pattern

The first level solidifies the understanding of the Singleton pattern. A class is developed to emulate a command history, ensuring that only one instance exists throughout the application. This implementation is ideal for managing a unique global state, allowing commands to be added, removed, and listed from a centralized point. .

Abstract Factory Pattern

The second exercise centers on the Abstract Factory pattern, which facilitates the creation of related object families without coupling the code to concrete classes. To demonstrate this, an international information manager is built, capable of generating addresses and phone numbers that adhere to the specific formats of different countries, thus keeping the system flexible and extensible.

Command Pattern

Finally, the Command pattern is explored. A system is designed to control different types of vehicles (car, bicycle, airplane, boat), encapsulating actions like starting, accelerating, and braking into command objects. This decouples the invoker of the request from the receiver that executes it, making the system modular, easy to extend, and capable of supporting new operations or vehicles seamlessly. .
